# Machine Learning Internship Projects - CognoRise InfoTech
----------
## Overview
As part of my Machine Learning Internship at CognoRise InfoTech, I worked on multiple projects to apply various machine learning algorithms across different datasets. This repository contains the code and results for four main tasks, where I implemented several classifiers to solve real world problems such as diabetes prediction, breast cancer classification, spam email detection, and sentiment analysis on movie reviews.
## Projects
### 1. Diabetes Prediction
#### Objective: To predict whether a patient has diabetes based on medical features such as glucose level, age, BMI, etc.

#### Algorithms Used:
* Random Forest Classifier
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* AdaBoost Classifier
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree Classifier
#### Technologies Used:
* Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib
### 2. Breast Cancer Classification
#### Objective: To classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using features extracted from mammograms.

#### Algorithms Used:

* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Random Forest Classifier
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Logistic Regression
#### Technologies Used:

* Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib
### 3. Spam Email Detection
#### Objective: To detect spam emails based on the content of the emails.

#### Algorithms Used:

* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest Classifier
* AdaBoost Classifier
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
#### Technologies Used:

* Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, NLTK
### 4. Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews
#### Objective: To analyze the sentiment (positive or negative) of movie reviews based on textual data.

#### Algorithms Used:

* Naive Bayes Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* XGBoost Classifier
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree Classifier
### Technologies Used:

* Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, NLTK
## Results
For each project, the classifiers were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
## Notable Achievements:
* Successfully implemented a wide variety of supervised learning algorithms across different domains.
* Developed a robust understanding of feature importance and model interpretability.
* Conducted thorough evaluation and comparison of models based on performance metrics.
## Conclusion
This repository demonstrates my ability to work with a range of machine learning models and apply them to solve complex classification problems. Each task provided valuable insights into how different algorithms handle various types of data, and how performance varies across domains.
